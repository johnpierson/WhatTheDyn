# WhatTheDyn

Autodesk Revit plugin project organised into multiple solution files that target versions 2020 - 2025.

### Technologies Used

* C# 12
* .NET Framework 4.8
* .NET 8

### Getting Started

Before you can build this project, you will need to install .NET, depending upon the solution file you are building. If you haven't already installed these
frameworks, you can do so by visiting the following:

* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
* [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)

After installing the necessary frameworks, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

### Building

We recommend JetBrains Rider as preferred IDE, since it has outstanding .NET support. If you don't have Rider installed, you can download it
from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

1. Open JetBrains Rider
2. Click on `File -> Open` and choose the RevitLookup.sln file to open.
3. In the `Solutions Configuration` drop-down menu, select `Release R25` or `Debug R25`. Suffix `R25` means compiling for the Revit 2025.
4. After the solution loads, you can build it by clicking on `Build -> Build Solution`.

Also, you can use Visual Studio. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Click on `File -> Open -> Project/Solution` and locate your solution file to open.
3. In the `Solutions Configuration` drop-down menu, select `Release R25` or `Debug R25`. Suffix `R25` means compiling for the Revit 2025.
4. After the solution loads, you can build it by clicking on `Build -> Build Solution`.

### MSI installer and bundle build on the local machine

To build the project for all versions, create the installer and bundle, the project uses [NUKE](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke)

To execute your NUKE build locally, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install NUKE as a global tool**. First, make sure you have NUKE installed as a global tool. You can install it using dotnet CLI:

    ```powershell
    dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global
    ```

   You only need to do this once on your machine.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**. Open a terminal / command prompt and navigate to your project's root directory.
3. **Run the build**. Once you have navigated to your project's root directory, you can run the NUKE build by calling:

   Compile:
   ```powershell
   nuke
   ```

   Create installer:
   ```powershell
   nuke createinstaller
   ```

   Create installer and bundle:
   ```powershell
   nuke createinstaller createbundle
   ```

   This command will execute the NUKE build defined in your project.

### Create new release on GitHub

Publishing the release, generating the installer and bundle, is performed automatically on GitHub.

To execute your NUKE build on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. Merge all your commits into the `main` / `master` branch.
2. Navigate to the `Build/Build.Configuration.cs` file.
3. Increase the `Version` value.
4. Make a commit.
5. Push your changes to GitHub, everything will happen automatically, and you can follow the progress in the Actions section of the repository page.
